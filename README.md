# Discord tipbot for digibyte
This bot is written in Python 3.
Overall it works without serious problems in digibyte discord community.
However, I recommend you to use it CAREFULLY because we can see some unstable behavior.
Otherwise, you'll lose some your DGB coins.

Depends: discord.py, bitcoinrpc
